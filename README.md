🌾 Crop Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning–based application designed to assist farmers and agricultural planners in selecting the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.
The system uses parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall to predict the best crop for cultivation.

This project aims to promote smart agriculture and improve crop productivity using data-driven decision-making.
