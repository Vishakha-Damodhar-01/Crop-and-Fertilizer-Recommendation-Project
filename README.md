# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning–based application that helps farmers and agricultural planners choose the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.

The system predicts the best crop using parameters such as **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall**, promoting smart and sustainable agriculture.
